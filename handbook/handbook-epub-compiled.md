# Introduction #

## Sociocracy 3.0... ##

...is a method for growing **effective, agile and resilient organization**s of **any size,** from small start-ups to large international networks and nationwide, multi-agency collaboration.

...provides a collection of **principles and patterns** to **dynamically steer and evolve organizations**.

...incrementally processes **available information** into **continuous improvement of products, processes and skills**.

...helps organizations making **the best use of the talent already present**, and to grow flexible organizational **structures that support effective travel of information**.

...contains a **soft, iterative approach to implementation** that **meets organizations where they** are and helps them move forward at their own pace.

 ...draws on the *collective intelligence* of the group

...facilitates the development of strategies that are “*good enough for now*” and “*safe enough to try*”

...fosters accountability and a sense of engagement
...is a transformational mechanism for both individuals and the whole organization

Sociocracy 3.0 may be applied within...

* ...startups
* ...small and medium businesses
* ...large international, networked organizations
* ...families
* ...investor-funded organizations
* ...communities

**What’s in a word?**

* *socio*
    * from Latin *socius* - companion, friend
* *-cracy*
    * from Ancient Greek krátos - “power, rule”
* different to the rule of the *demos*
    * the general mass of people with voting privileges

## A Brief History of Sociocracy  From 1851 to Today ##

![](img/general/history.png)

* 1851 – Auguste Comte
    * Scientific method applied to society
    * Sociocracy is “*the social order of the future*” - not yet achievable but inevitable
* 1881 – Lester Frank Ward
    * redefined the term Sociocracy to describe the rule of the people with relationships with each other
* 1926 -1954 - Kees Boeke
    * Established the first sociocracy in his residential school (based on Quaker consensus principles)
    * Book “*Sociocracy: Democracy as it might be*” (1945)
* 1970's - Gerard Endenburg
    * Student in Kees Boeke’s school
    * Integrated principles from Engineering and Cybernetics
    * In his company Endenburg Electrotechniek he evolved “*The Sociocratic Circle-Organization Method*” (later becoming "*The Sociocratic Method*")
* 1978 - Sociocratisch Centrum Utrecht
    * created to promote "*The Sociocratic Method*"
* 1994 -  New law in the Netherlands
    * Sociocratic organizations are no longer required to have a worker’s council
* 2000 - emergence of a now wide-spread grassroots movement
* 2007 - *We the People*
    * John Buck / Sharon Villines make Sociocracy accessible to the English-speaking world
* 2014 The Sociocracy 3.0 Movement is born

**The Sociocracy 3.0 Movement...**

* ...develops and evolves Sociocracy 3.0 to make it available and applicable to as many organizations as possible.
* ...provides resources under a Creative Commons Free Culture License to learn, practice and teach Sociocracy 3.0.
* ...is a distributed network of pioneering consultants and trainers from a variety of fields, who:
    * share a deep appreciation for the transformational potential of sociocracy to help organizations and their members thrive
    * dedicate some of their time to developing and evolving Sociocracy 3.0

## Why "Sociocracy 3.0" ##

Respect to the lineage, and a step forward.

* un-centralized distribution
    * **open**: principle-based and modular patterns make it easy to adapt the method
    * **free**: eliminates barriers to entry
* a change method that meets organizations where they are
* condensed to the essentials
* integrated with lean and agile thinking
* new ways to evolve organizational structure

## Design Goals ##

![](img/general/design-goals.png)

* **open**:
	* Do with it what you want
	* Take just what you need
	* Remix, extend and adapt it as you like
* **free**
	* Free resources
	* no hidden fees
	* no certifications
	* no small print!
* **effective**:
	* Principles and tools have been tried and tested for decades in many organizations.
	* need-driven, value-driven, customer focus

* **actionable**:
	 * There's something that YOU can use right now, regardless of your unique context
	* Sociocracy 3.0 contains lots of ideas you can try out within your area of influence.
* **lightweight**:
	* just the essentials: Common-sense practices, bare-bone processes.
	* no stuff that gets in the way
	* no busywork

## Patterns ##

**Definition**: *A pattern is a template for successfully navigating a specific context.*

* patterns are discovered through observing many organizations as they solve problems
* patterns may need to be adapted and evolved to suit differing contexts.

## Principles behind Sociocracy 3.0 ##

* Sociocracy is built on 7 core principles
* the core principles are also values that shape organizational culture
* understanding these principles is paramount to adopting and adapting Sociocracy 3.0 patterns
*  practicing Sociocracy 3.0 helps people appreciate the essential value that these core principles bring,  both to individuals and organizations

![](img/general/s3-principles-plain.png)

### Principle: Empiricism ###

**Knowledge in an organization can only be gained through experience, as it is highly dependent on context.**

* basis of the scientific method
* in a complex adaptive system all knowledge is tentative
* embrace change: continuous revision and falsification
* reality vs. assumptions
* learning organization

### Principle: Consent ###

**Decisions are made only in the absence of reasoned objection from those affected by them.**

* when dealing with complexity, group wisdom exceeds individual abilities
* deliberately seeking objections invites collective intelligence:
    *  allows for harvesting information to improve the decision
    *  helps identify misunderstanding early
    *  fosters support and accountability for decisions

### Principle: Effectiveness ###

**Devote time only to that which brings you closer to achieving your objectives.**

* avoid waste
* remove impediments
* good enough for now, safe enough to try

### Principle: Equivalence ###

**Everyone affected by a decision has the power to withdraw consent on the basis of reasoned objection.**

* position, rank, function or role has no special influence in decision making

### Principle: Transparency ###

**All information is accessible to anyone in an organization. Confidentiality requires consent.**

* all relevant information is kept up-to-date
* historical information is archived for reference

### Principle: Continuous Improvement ###

**Evolution is more effective than revolution (most of the time).**

* applies to everything (e.g. strategies, guidelines, products, skills, processes and tools)
* respond to change by building on and transforming what is already there
* small steps create less resistance, lower risk, and accommodate steady empirical learning

### Principle: Accountability ###

**The process of entering and keeping agreements, and managing  expectations in any relationship.**

* an obligation or willingness to do what we agree to and to answer for when we don’t
* a principle relevant to groups, organizations and individuals
* a shift from being *held to account*, and towards a culture of *self-accountability*

## Organizations ##

An organization is defined by its values, driver and strategy.

* an organizations values define **culture** and set parameters for **action**
* an organizations **existence** is motivated by its driver
* an organizations **service** is defined by its strategy

* organizations are aligned towards values, driver and strategy
*  with Sociocracy 3.0, *purpose* is implicit (to satisfy drivers)
* to transition towards Sociocracy 3.0 an organization:
    *  identifies values and driver of the organization
    *  incorporates vision, mission, aims or objectives in the strategy
    *  seeks out drivers for all existing policy and agreements (including circles and roles)


# The Patterns



## Making And Evolving Agreements ##

...


### Agreements ###

We respond to drivers through agreements.

**Definition:** _A agreement is an agreed upon guideline, pattern, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value._

* agreements are created in order to satisfy drivers
* agreements are the **accountability of the circle** that created them
* each agreement includes **evaluation criteria** and is subject to **regular review**
    *  review dates are specific to each agreement
    *  agreements are reviewed in context to its driver

![](img/tension-driver-domain/driver-agreement-improvement.png)

#### Template for Agreements

![](img/agreements/agreement-template.png)


### Circle ###

A circle...

* ...is the basic building block of an organization
* ...is a group of people gathered around a driver (permanent or temporary)
* ...makes all agreements by consent
* ...is accountable for its own development

**Definition:** _A circle is a semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing group of people gathering around a driver._

![](img/circle/circle-driver.png)

* ...**semi-autonomous**:
    * each has a unique driver and can create value independently
* ...**self-organizing**:
    * independent in organizing day-to-day-work
* ...**self-governing**:
    * independent in creating strategy and agreements


### Consent Decision Making ###

* Consent is the absence of objections
    * everyone affected by a decision can "live with it"
    * consent is not consensus with unanimity
* Consent is used to make and evolve all agreements in a circle
* Objections stop proposals becoming agreements
* Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization
* Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*
* Every agreement has a review date

Consent Decision Making...

* is a facilitated decision making process
* deliberately harvests reasoned objections in order to integrate the wisdom they contain in proposals or existing agreements
* helps balance equivalence and effectiveness
* experienced groups can move quickly through the stages of Consent Decision Making

#### Harvesting Objections to Capture Emergent Wisdom ####

![](img/agreements/cdm-condensed.png)


### Deliverables ###

...


### Driver ###

**Definition:**: _A driver is that which motivates us into action: what is happening in a specific situation and what’s needed._

### Responses to a Driver ###

* the response to a driver always involves the **adaptation of an existing agreement, or creation of a new one**, including:
    * changing the plan: adding a task or project
    * adaptation  or creation of a role
    * creation of a new circle
        * driver review is delegated to new circle

#### Drivers Are Subject to Regular Review ####

* Is the description of the current reality correct?
* Do we still associate the same needs with the current reality?
* Is the driver still within our domain?
* Is the driver still relevant?

#### Sociocracy 3.0 and Lean Thinking ####

##### Value and Waste #####

**Definition**:  _The importance, worth or usefulness of something for satisfaction of a driver._

**Value**:

* value is **not** an **inherent** property as it only exists in relation to a driver
* value can be quantified by **measuring the progression** towards satisfaction of a driver
    * value is not necessarily expressed in currency or time
* **continuous improvement of processes is focused on optimizing the flow of value through an organization**

**Definition:** _Waste is anything not necessary (essential) for - or standing in the way of - effective satisfaction of a driver._

Adopting the concept of value and waste makes many tools and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** available to support organizations running on Sociocracy 3.0:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method

##### Waste and Continuous Improvement #####

* Establishing a process for ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness
* Adaptation to changing environment is built into the process

##### Identifying Waste #####

![](img/workflow-and-value/drivers-value-waste.png)

* waste exist in many different forms and on different levels of abstraction
    * tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models...
* some tensions reveal waste
* learning to identify waste is a journey
    * along the way we also learn how to evolve our drivers


### Evaluate Agreements ###

...


### Evaluation Criteria ###

![](img/agreements/outcome-and-criteria.png)


### Intended Outcome ###

![](img/agreements/outcome-and-criteria.png)


### Objections ###

**Definition:** _An objection is a reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of (more) effective satisfaction of an existing driver._

In sociocracy we deliberately seek objections as they reveal
wisdom that can be used to improve proposals and agreements.

Objections...

* ...are gifts
* ...reveal wisdom seeking expression into the consciousness of a circle
* ...reveal opportunities or impediments
* ...emerge through individuals and belong to the whole circle
* we love objections in sociocracy

#### Questions That Help to Validate Objections ####

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?

* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) **agreement**...

    * ...jeopardizes the satisfaction of a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to satisfying a driver?
    * ...can be improved significantly?

### Concerns... ###

* ...are not objections
* ...don't stop us from making agreements
* ...often contain wisdom
* ...can be recorded in the logbook
    * ...to further evolve agreements
    * ...to set evaluation criteria (including review date)


### Proposal Forming ###

Proposal Forming...

* ...is similar to condensed design thinking process
* ...taps the collective intelligence of a group
* ...involves people in co-creating agreements
* ...fosters accountability and a sense of ownership

![Co-Creating a Response to a Drivers](img/agreements/proposal-forming-medium.png)

#### Proposal Forming Process ####

1. **Identify** the driver
2. **Consider**: Collect considerations as questions that reveal the scope of the issue
3. **Create**: Gather ingredients/ideas for solutions
4. **Refine**: Design a proposal from some or all of the ingredients
5. **Review**: process with consent decision making


### Qualifying Drivers ###

** ...in order to avoid action bias**

>_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._ (Viktor E. Frankl)

We consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action.


### Resolve Objections ###

### Methods for Resolving Objections ###

* ask proposal owner
* ask member with objection to amend proposal
* facilitator amends proposal
* "How would you solve this" – round
* Brief Dialogue – 2 or 3 people
* Brief group discussion
* refer to proposal forming
* drop the proposal
* Re-work – Send back to higher / lower circle
* Form a temporary circle to review, research, revise


### Strategy ###

![](img/drivers-and-subdrivers/driver-and-domains.png)


### Those Affected Decide ###

...



## Governance ##

Governance is the process of creating and evolving agreements in response to drivers.


### Governance Backlog ###

...


### Governance Meeting ###

Circles meet at regular intervals to create and evolve agreements in response to drivers.

* usually ~60 min
* regular cadence, usually 2-4 weeks

#### Navigation Meeting Structure

* Opening Round
    * attune to one another and to the driver the circle serves
* Administrative Matters
    * consent to last minutes, dates, consent to agenda
* Agenda Items
    * Short Reports
    * Processing Tensions
    * Proposal Forming and Consent to Proposals
    * Review of Agreements, Strategy and Driver
    * Defining Roles and Selecting People for Roles
    * Consent to Role Improvement Plans
* Closing Round
    * evaluation of meeting and results, future agenda items


### Navigating via tension ###

**Definition**:  _A tension is the subjective experience of contradiction between reality and that which we desire or anticipate._

* individuals act as sensors (nerve endings) for the organization
* tension is experienced whenever our perception of our environment is in conflict with:
    * that which we desire or had anticipated
    * our values (and principles)
* problems, challenges, and feelings of unease are all tensions

![](img/tension-driver-domain/navigate-via-tensions.png)

#### From Tension to Driver ####

* investigating tension leads to the discovery of drivers
* to identify a possible driver behind a tension we:
    * **describe** the current reality
    * **identify** the needs we associate with that reality
* in the process, we resolve some tensions as **misunderstandings**
* we validate drivers
    * some tensions are **outside the domain** we can address

### Support Roles ###

...



## Organizational Structure ##

The primary function of organizational structure is **to enable effective collaboration** by aligning the flow of information to  support the flow of value..

**Organizational structure needs to evolve continuously** in order to adapt to a changing environment.

**Semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing circles** are the basic building blocks for organizational structure.

### Structural Patterns ###

* Sociocracy 3.0 describes a variety of patterns to grow organizational structure
* patterns apply to different layers of abstraction (basic, micro, macro and meta)
* different patterns serve different drivers
* patterns can be combined as needed
