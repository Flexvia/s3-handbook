{\ldots}provides a collection of \textbf{principles and patterns} to \textbf{dynamically steer and evolve organizations}.

{\ldots}incrementally processes \textbf{available information} into \textbf{continuous improvement of products, processes and skills}.

{\ldots}helps organizations making \textbf{the best use of the talent already present}, and to grow flexible organizational \textbf{structures that support effective travel of information}.

{\ldots}contains a \textbf{soft, iterative approach to implementation} that \textbf{meets organizations where they} are and helps them move forward at their own pace.

{\ldots}draws on the \emph{collective intelligence} of the group

{\ldots}facilitates the development of strategies that are “\emph{good enough for now}” and “\emph{safe enough to try}”

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Why ``Sociocracy 3.0''}

\chapter{Design Goals}
\label{designgoals}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\textwidth,height=0.75\textheight]{img/general/design-goals.png}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{open}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Do with it what you want

\item Take just what you need

\item Remix, extend and adapt it as you like

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{free}

\begin{itemize}
\item Free resources

\item no hidden fees

\item no certifications

\item no small print!

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{effective}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Principles and tools have been tried and tested for decades in many organizations.

\item need-driven, value-driven, customer focus

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{actionable}:

\begin{itemize}
\item There's something that YOU can use right now, regardless of your unique context

\item Sociocracy 3.0 contains lots of ideas you can try out within your area of influence.

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{lightweight}:

\begin{itemize}
\item just the essentials: Common-sense practices, bare-bone processes.

\item no stuff that gets in the way

\item no busywork

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Patterns}
\label{patterns}

\textbf{Definition}: \emph{A pattern is a template for successfully navigating a specific context.}

\begin{itemize}
\item patterns are discovered through observing many organizations as they solve problems

\item patterns may need to be adapted and evolved to suit differing contexts.

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Principles behind Sociocracy 3.0}
\label{principlesbehindsociocracy3.0}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sociocracy is built on 7 core principles

\item the core principles are also values that shape organizational culture

\item understanding these principles is paramount to adopting and adapting Sociocracy 3.0 patterns

\item practicing Sociocracy 3.0 helps people appreciate the essential value that these core principles bring, both to individuals and organizations

\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\textwidth,height=0.75\textheight]{img/general/s3-principles-plain.png}
\end{figure}

\section{Principle: Empiricism}
\label{principle:empiricism}

\textbf{Knowledge in an organization can only be gained through experience, as it is highly dependent on context.}

\begin{itemize}
\item basis of the scientific method

\item in a complex adaptive system all knowledge is tentative

\item embrace change: continuous revision and falsification

\item reality vs. assumptions

\item learning organization

\end{itemize}

\section{Principle: Consent}
\label{principle:consent}

\textbf{Decisions are made only in the absence of reasoned objection from those affected by them.}

\begin{itemize}
\item when dealing with complexity, group wisdom exceeds individual abilities

\item deliberately seeking objections invites collective intelligence:

\begin{itemize}
\item allows for harvesting information to improve the decision

\item helps identify misunderstanding early

\item fosters support and accountability for decisions

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Principle: Effectiveness}
\label{principle:effectiveness}

\textbf{Devote time only to that which brings you closer to achieving your objectives.}

\begin{itemize}
\item avoid waste

\item remove impediments

\item good enough for now, safe enough to try

\end{itemize}

\section{Principle: Equivalence}
\label{principle:equivalence}

\textbf{Everyone affected by a decision has the power to withdraw consent on the basis of reasoned objection.}

\begin{itemize}
\item position, rank, function or role has no special influence in decision making

\end{itemize}

\section{Principle: Transparency}
\label{principle:transparency}

\textbf{All information is accessible to anyone in an organization. Confidentiality requires consent.}

\begin{itemize}
\item all relevant information is kept up-to-date

\item historical information is archived for reference

\end{itemize}

\section{Principle: Continuous Improvement}
\label{principle:continuousimprovement}

\textbf{Evolution is more effective than revolution (most of the time).}

\begin{itemize}
\item applies to everything (e.g. strategies, guidelines, products, skills, processes and tools)

\item respond to change by building on and transforming what is already there

\item small steps create less resistance, lower risk, and accommodate steady empirical learning

\end{itemize}

\section{Principle: Accountability}
\label{principle:accountability}

\textbf{The process of entering and keeping agreements, and managing expectations in any relationship.}

\begin{itemize}
\item an obligation or willingness to do what we agree to and to answer for when we don’t

\item a principle relevant to groups, organizations and individuals

\item a shift from being \emph{held to account}, and towards a culture of \emph{self-accountability}

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Organizations}
\label{organizations}

An organization is defined by its values, driver and strategy.

\begin{itemize}
\item an organizations values define \textbf{culture} and set parameters for \textbf{action}

\item an organizations \textbf{existence} is motivated by its driver

\item an organizations \textbf{service} is defined by its strategy

\item organizations are aligned towards values, driver and strategy

\item with Sociocracy 3.0, \emph{purpose} is implicit (to satisfy drivers)

\item to transition towards Sociocracy 3.0 an organization:

\begin{itemize}
\item identifies values and driver of the organization

\item incorporates vision, mission, aims or objectives in the strategy

\item seeks out drivers for all existing policy and agreements (including circles and roles)

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\part{The Patterns}
\label{thepatterns}

\chapter{Making And Evolving Agreements}
\label{makingandevolvingagreements}

{\ldots}

\section{Agreements}
\label{agreements}

We respond to drivers through agreements.

\textbf{Definition:} \emph{A agreement is an agreed upon guideline, pattern, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value.}

\begin{itemize}
\item agreements are created in order to satisfy drivers

\item agreements are the \textbf{accountability of the circle} that created them

\item each agreement includes \textbf{evaluation criteria} and is subject to \textbf{regular review}

\begin{itemize}
\item review dates are specific to each agreement

\item agreements are reviewed in context to its driver

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\textwidth,height=0.75\textheight]{img/tension-driver-domain/driver-agreement-improvement.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Template for Agreements}
\label{templateforagreements}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\textwidth,height=0.75\textheight]{img/agreements/agreement-template.png}
\end{figure}

\section{Circle}
\label{circle}

A circle{\ldots}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\ldots}is the basic building block of an organization

\item {\ldots}is a group of people gathered around a driver (permanent or temporary)

\item {\ldots}makes all agreements by consent

\item {\ldots}is accountable for its own development

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Definition:} \emph{A circle is a semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing group of people gathering around a driver.}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\textwidth,height=0.75\textheight]{img/circle/circle-driver.png}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\ldots}\textbf{semi-autonomous}:

\begin{itemize}
\item each has a unique driver and can create value independently

\end{itemize}

\item {\ldots}\textbf{self-organizing}:

\begin{itemize}
\item independent in organizing day-to-day-work

\end{itemize}

\item {\ldots}\textbf{self-governing}:

\begin{itemize}
\item independent in creating strategy and agreements

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Consent Decision Making}
\label{consentdecisionmaking}

\begin{itemize}
\item Consent is the absence of objections

\begin{itemize}
\item everyone affected by a decision can ``live with it''

\item consent is not consensus with unanimity

\end{itemize}

\item Consent is used to make and evolve all agreements in a circle

\item Objections stop proposals becoming agreements

\item Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization

\item Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be \emph{good enough for now, safe enough to try}

\item Every agreement has a review date

\end{itemize}

Consent Decision Making{\ldots}

\begin{itemize}
\item is a facilitated decision making process

\item deliberately harvests reasoned objections in order to integrate the wisdom they contain in proposals or existing agreements

\item helps balance equivalence and effectiveness

\item experienced groups can move quickly through the stages of Consent Decision Making

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Harvesting Objections to Capture Emergent Wisdom}
\label{harvestingobjectionstocaptureemergentwisdom}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\textwidth,height=0.75\textheight]{img/agreements/cdm-condensed.png}
\end{figure}

\section{Deliverables}
\label{deliverables}

{\ldots}

\section{Driver}
\label{driver}

\textbf{Definition:}: \emph{A driver is that which motivates us into action: what is happening in a specific situation and what’s needed.}

\section{Responses to a Driver}
\label{responsestoadriver}

\begin{itemize}
\item the response to a driver always involves the \textbf{adaptation of an existing agreement, or creation of a new one}, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item changing the plan: adding a task or project

\item adaptation or creation of a role

\item creation of a new circle

\begin{itemize}
\item driver review is delegated to new circle

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Drivers Are Subject to Regular Review}
\label{driversaresubjecttoregularreview}

\begin{itemize}
\item Is the description of the current reality correct?

\item Do we still associate the same needs with the current reality?

\item Is the driver still within our domain?

\item Is the driver still relevant?

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sociocracy 3.0 and Lean Thinking}
\label{sociocracy3.0andleanthinking}

\subsubsection{Value and Waste}
\label{valueandwaste}

\textbf{Definition}: \emph{The importance, worth or usefulness of something for satisfaction of a driver.}

\textbf{Value}:

\begin{itemize}
\item value is \textbf{not} an \textbf{inherent} property as it only exists in relation to a driver

\item value can be quantified by \textbf{measuring the progression} towards satisfaction of a driver

\begin{itemize}
\item value is not necessarily expressed in currency or time

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{continuous improvement of processes is focused on optimizing the flow of value through an organization}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Definition:} \emph{Waste is anything not necessary (essential) for - or standing in the way of - effective satisfaction of a driver.}

Adopting the concept of value and waste makes many tools and ideas from \textbf{lean production} and \textbf{lean software development} available to support organizations running on Sociocracy 3.0:

\begin{itemize}
\item value stream mapping

\item various strategies for eliminating waste

\item the Kanban Method

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Waste and Continuous Improvement}
\label{wasteandcontinuousimprovement}

\begin{itemize}
\item Establishing a process for ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness

\item Adaptation to changing environment is built into the process

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Identifying Waste}
\label{identifyingwaste}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\textwidth,height=0.75\textheight]{img/workflow-and-value/drivers-value-waste.png}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item waste exist in many different forms and on different levels of abstraction

\begin{itemize}
\item tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models{\ldots}

\end{itemize}

\item some tensions reveal waste

\item learning to identify waste is a journey

\begin{itemize}
\item along the way we also learn how to evolve our drivers

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluate Agreements}
\label{evaluateagreements}

{\ldots}

\section{Evaluation Criteria}
\label{evaluationcriteria}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\textwidth,height=0.75\textheight]{img/agreements/outcome-and-criteria.png}
\end{figure}

\section{Intended Outcome}
\label{intendedoutcome}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\textwidth,height=0.75\textheight]{img/agreements/outcome-and-criteria.png}
\end{figure}

\section{Objections}
\label{objections}

\textbf{Definition:} \emph{An objection is a reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of (more) effective satisfaction of an existing driver.}

In sociocracy we deliberately seek objections as they reveal
wisdom that can be used to improve proposals and agreements.

Objections{\ldots}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\ldots}are gifts

\item {\ldots}reveal wisdom seeking expression into the consciousness of a circle

\item {\ldots}reveal opportunities or impediments

\item {\ldots}emerge through individuals and belong to the whole circle

\item we love objections in sociocracy

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Questions That Help to Validate Objections}
\label{questionsthathelptovalidateobjections}

\begin{itemize}
\item Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?

\item Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) \textbf{agreement}{\ldots}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\ldots}jeopardizes the satisfaction of a driver?

\item {\ldots}is in conflict with the organization's values?

\item {\ldots}prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to satisfying a driver?

\item {\ldots}can be improved significantly?

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Concerns{\ldots}}
\label{concerns...}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\ldots}are not objections

\item {\ldots}don't stop us from making agreements

\item {\ldots}often contain wisdom

\item {\ldots}can be recorded in the logbook

\begin{itemize}
\item {\ldots}to further evolve agreements

\item {\ldots}to set evaluation criteria (including review date)

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Proposal Forming}
\label{proposalforming}

Proposal Forming{\ldots}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\ldots}is similar to condensed design thinking process

\item {\ldots}taps the collective intelligence of a group

\item {\ldots}involves people in co-creating agreements

\item {\ldots}fosters accountability and a sense of ownership

\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\textwidth,height=0.75\textheight]{img/agreements/proposal-forming-medium.png}
\caption{Co-Creating a Response to a Drivers}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Proposal Forming Process}
\label{proposalformingprocess}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Identify} the driver

\item \textbf{Consider}: Collect considerations as questions that reveal the scope of the issue

\item \textbf{Create}: Gather ingredients\slash ideas for solutions

\item \textbf{Refine}: Design a proposal from some or all of the ingredients

\item \textbf{Review}: process with consent decision making

\end{enumerate}

\section{Qualifying Drivers}
\label{qualifyingdrivers}

** {\ldots}in order to avoid action bias**

\begin{quote}

\emph{Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.} (Viktor E. Frankl)
\end{quote}

We consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action.

\section{Resolve Objections}
\label{resolveobjections}

\section{Methods for Resolving Objections}
\label{methodsforresolvingobjections}

\begin{itemize}
\item ask proposal owner

\item ask member with objection to amend proposal

\item facilitator amends proposal

\item ``How would you solve this'' – round

\item Brief Dialogue – 2 or 3 people

\item Brief group discussion

\item refer to proposal forming

\item drop the proposal

\item Re-work – Send back to higher \slash  lower circle

\item Form a temporary circle to review, research, revise

\end{itemize}

\section{Strategy}
\label{strategy}

\section{Navigating via tension}
\label{navigatingviatension}

\textbf{Definition}: \emph{A tension is the subjective experience of contradiction between reality and that which we desire or anticipate.}

\begin{itemize}
\item individuals act as sensors (nerve endings) for the organization

\item tension is experienced whenever our perception of our environment is in conflict with:

\begin{itemize}
\item that which we desire or had anticipated

\item our values (and principles)

\end{itemize}

\item problems, challenges, and feelings of unease are all tensions

\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

\subsection{From Tension to Driver}
\label{fromtensiontodriver}

\begin{itemize}
\item investigating tension leads to the discovery of drivers

\item to identify a possible driver behind a tension we:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{describe} the current reality

\item \textbf{identify} the needs we associate with that reality

\end{itemize}

\item in the process, we resolve some tensions as \textbf{misunderstandings}
